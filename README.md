### Project Description
Deadline Panic Reducer is a web-based productivity tool that helps users manage multiple deadlines by calculating urgency levels and reducing last-minute stress. It analyzes task difficulty, importance, and remaining time to generate a panic score and suggests structured action plans. The system promotes better planning, focus, and consistent progress using browser-based storage without requiring a backend. 🚀


### The Problem statement
Many people experience stress and anxiety when handling multiple deadlines.
This project aims to:

1. Reduce last-minute panic
2. Improve time planning
3. Increase productivity
4. Provide structured task management

### The Solution
The project solves deadline-related stress by converting emotional panic into logical task prioritization.
It works by:
* Calculating a Panic Score using task difficulty, importance, and time remaining to identify urgency levels.
* Prioritizing Tasks Automatically based on urgency instead of guesswork.
* Breaking Large Tasks into Smaller Subtasks to make work feel manageable.
* Providing Focus Timers to encourage structured work sessions.
* Visualizing Workload and Progress to reduce uncertainty and improve planning.

By transforming overwhelming deadlines into clear, actionable steps, the system helps users stay calm, organized, and productive.

The Deadline Panic Reducer follows a fully client-side architecture where all operations are handled within the browser. The user interacts with the interface built using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript processes inputs, calculates the panic score, manages tasks, and controls the focus timer. All task details, deadlines, progress data, and session information are stored using LocalStorage or IndexedDB, eliminating the need for a backend server. The data flow moves from user input to JavaScript processing, then to browser storage, and finally updates the UI dynamically, ensuring fast performance and seamless interaction.
